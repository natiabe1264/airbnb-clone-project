### 🧑 Users
Stores information about guests and hosts.
- `id`: Primary key
- `name`: Full name of the user
- `email`: Unique email for authentication
- `password_hash`: Encrypted password
- `is_host`: Boolean flag to distinguish between guests and hosts

### 🏡 Properties
Represents accommodations listed by hosts.
- `id`: Primary key
- `title`: Name or title of the property
- `description`: Property details
- `location`: Address or geolocation
- `owner_id`: Foreign key to `Users`

### 📅 Bookings
Tracks reservation information for properties.
- `id`: Primary key
- `user_id`: Foreign key to `Users` (the guest)
- `property_id`: Foreign key to `Properties`
- `start_date`: Check-in date
- `end_date`: Check-out date

### 💵 Payments
Handles payment transactions for bookings.
- `id`: Primary key
- `booking_id`: Foreign key to `Bookings`
- `amount`: Total payment amount
- `payment_status`: Enum or string (e.g., pending, completed, failed)
- `payment_date`: Timestamp of transaction

### 🌟 Reviews
Allows users to rate and review properties.
- `id`: Primary key
- `user_id`: Foreign key to `Users`
- `property_id`: Foreign key to `Properties`
- `rating`: Integer or decimal score
- `comment`: Text review

### 🔗 Entity Relationships
- A **user** can be both a **host** (owning properties) and a **guest** (making bookings).
- A **property** belongs to one **user** (host) but can have many **bookings** and **reviews**.
- A **booking** is made by a **user** for a **property**.
- A **payment** is linked to a **booking**.
- A **review** is written by a **user** for a **property**.

## ✨ Feature Breakdown

This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project and their role in delivering a robust booking platform.

### 👤 User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and profile management for users. This feature ensures secure access to the platform and differentiates between guests and hosts.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings. Each property includes details such as location, description, pricing, and availability.

### 📆 Booking System
Enables guests to browse available properties, make reservations, and manage booking details. This feature supports check-in/check-out tracking and prevents scheduling conflicts.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Processes transactions related to bookings, ensuring secure and accurate payment handling. This includes tracking payment status and recording transaction data.

### ⭐ Review System
Allows guests to leave feedback on their stays by submitting reviews and ratings. This builds trust and transparency between users and hosts.

### 📚 API Documentation
Provides clear, standardized documentation for all REST and GraphQL API endpoints using the OpenAPI standard. This improves usability and integration for frontend and third-party developers.

### ⚙️ Data Optimization
Implements indexing and caching strategies to enhance performance and reduce server load. This ensures smooth and efficient data retrieval across the application.

## 🔒 API Security

Securing backend APIs is essential for maintaining the integrity, privacy, and reliability of the Airbnb Clone platform. The following measures will be implemented to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Purpose**: Ensures only registered users can access protected endpoints.
- **Implementation**: Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) will be used to validate user identity.
- **Importance**: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing or manipulating data like bookings or payments.

### 🎯 Authorization
- **Purpose**: Controls what authenticated users are allowed to do based on their roles (e.g., guest vs. host).
- **Implementation**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to resources like property creation or booking management.
- **Importance**: Ensures that users can only perform actions permitted by their role, protecting against privilege escalation.

### 🚦 Rate Limiting
- **Purpose**: Restricts the number of requests a user or IP can make within a certain time period.
- **Implementation**: Use of middleware like `django-ratelimit` or API gateway configurations.
- **Importance**: Prevents abuse, brute-force attacks, and reduces server overload.

### 🔍 Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Purpose**: Protects against common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Implementation**: Use of serializers and validators in Django REST Framework, along with escaping special characters.
- **Importance**: Prevents malicious users from injecting harmful code or corrupting data.

### 📊 Secure Data Transmission
- **Purpose**: Ensures all data sent between client and server is encrypted.
- **Implementation**: Enforcing HTTPS across the platform.
- **Importance**: Protects user credentials, payment data, and other sensitive information from being intercepted.

### 💼 Secure Payment Handling
- **Purpose**: Safeguards financial transactions between guests and hosts.
- **Implementation**: Integration with trusted third-party payment processors with secure APIs and compliance (e.g., PCI-DSS).
- **Importance**: Prevents fraud and ensures trust in the platform.

By implementing these security practices, we aim to build a resilient and trustworthy backend system for both hosts and guests.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are automated workflows that help streamline the software development process. 

**Continuous Integration (CI)** involves automatically building and testing the code every time changes are pushed to the repository. This helps catch bugs early, ensures code quality, and integrates changes frequently.

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** automates the release of the tested code to production or staging environments, making the deployment process faster, reliable, and less prone to human errors.

For this Airbnb Clone project, implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that:

- Code is automatically tested for bugs before merging.
- The backend API is deployed consistently in a reliable environment.
- Updates can be released frequently without manual intervention.

Common tools used to build CI/CD pipelines include:

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows directly in GitHub repositories.
- **Docker**: Packages the application in containers for consistent deployment across environments.
- **CI/CD platforms** like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitLab CI can also be used depending on the project needs.

By leveraging these tools, the development process becomes more efficient, and the risk of breaking changes in production is minimized.
