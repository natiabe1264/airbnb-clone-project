# üè° Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äì ProDev Project

## üìå Overview

This project is a backend-focused clone of Airbnb, designed as part of the **ProDev Backend Program** to simulate building a scalable, secure booking platform. It mimics real-world engineering workflows and emphasizes backend systems, database design, CI/CD, and team collaboration.

## üéØ Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a full-featured backend system that supports core functionalities of a booking platform, including user management, property listings, availability tracking, secure API endpoints, and automated deployment pipelines. It also aims to foster collaboration through version control, documentation, and team role clarity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project uses a combination of modern backend technologies to simulate a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. Below is an overview of each tool and its role in the system:

- **Django**: A powerful Python-based web framework used to build the core backend logic, define models, and implement RESTful APIs.

- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data, including users, listings, bookings, and transactions.

- **GraphQL**: An API query language that enables precise and efficient data fetching, giving clients control over the structure and size of the responses.

- **Docker**: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, making it easy to run consistently across different systems.

- **Git & GitHub**: Tools for version control and collaboration, allowing the team to manage source code, track changes, and coordinate development workflows.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD automation tool used to build, test, and deploy the application, ensuring smooth and consistent integration and delivery.

- **Markdown**: A markup language used to format documentation like the `README.md` file, making it clear and readable for developers and contributors.
