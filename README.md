# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend – ProDev Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a backend-focused clone of Airbnb, designed as part of the **ProDev Backend Program** to simulate building a scalable, secure booking platform. It mimics real-world engineering workflows and emphasizes backend systems, database design, CI/CD, and team collaboration.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a full-featured backend system that supports core functionalities of a booking platform, including user management, property listings, availability tracking, secure API endpoints, and automated deployment pipelines. It also aims to foster collaboration through version control, documentation, and team role clarity.

## 👥 Team Roles

The development of the Airbnb Clone backend involves a collaborative effort from various technical roles, each contributing to a key part of the system's success.

### 🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the core application logic and RESTful/GraphQL APIs. Implements features such as user authentication, property management, bookings, and reviews. Ensures code quality, scalability, and security best practices are followed.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the PostgreSQL database schema. Optimizes data storage, indexing, and query performance. Works closely with backend developers to ensure data integrity and efficient data access.

### ⚙️ DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment infrastructure, including Docker and CI/CD pipelines. Ensures the backend runs reliably in development and production environments. Sets up monitoring, logging, and automated testing workflows using tools like GitHub Actions.

### 🧪 QA Engineer
Tests the backend features and APIs to ensure they meet functional and performance requirements. Writes test cases, runs integration tests, and reports bugs. Validates user flows such as booking, payments, and authentication.



## 🛠️ Technology Stack

This project uses a combination of modern backend technologies to simulate a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. Below is an overview of each tool and its role in the system:

- **Django**: A powerful Python-based web framework used to build the core backend logic, define models, and implement RESTful APIs.

- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data, including users, listings, bookings, and transactions.

- **GraphQL**: An API query language that enables precise and efficient data fetching, giving clients control over the structure and size of the responses.

- **Docker**: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, making it easy to run consistently across different systems.

- **Git & GitHub**: Tools for version control and collaboration, allowing the team to manage source code, track changes, and coordinate development workflows.

- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD automation tool used to build, test, and deploy the application, ensuring smooth and consistent integration and delivery.

- **Markdown**: A markup language used to format documentation like the `README.md` file, making it clear and readable for developers and contributors.
